module LLM
  ##
  # The {LLM::Stream LLM::Stream} class provides the callback interface for
  # streamed model output in llm.rb.
  #
  # A stream object can be an instance of {LLM::Stream LLM::Stream} or a
  # subclass that overrides the callbacks it needs. For basic streaming,
  # llm.rb also accepts any object that implements `#<<`. {#queue} provides
  # a small helper for collecting asynchronous tool work started from a
  # callback.
  #
  # @note The `on_*` callbacks run inline with the streaming parser. They
  #   therefore block streaming progress and should generally return as
  #   quickly as possible.
  #
  # The most common callback is {#on_content}, which also maps to {#<<}.
  # Providers may also call {#on_reasoning_content} and {#on_tool_call} when
  # that data is available. Runtime features such as context compaction may
  # also emit lifecycle callbacks like {#on_transform} or {#on_compaction}.

    #   {LLM::Function::Return}. It can be sent back to the model, allowing
    #   the tool-call path to recover and the session to continue. Streamed
    #   tool resolution now prefers the current request tools, so
    #   {LLM.function}, MCP tools, bound tool instances, and normal
    #   {LLM::Tool LLM::Tool} classes can all resolve through the same
    #   request-local path.
