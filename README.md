mruby-llm is mruby's capable AI runtime and a [r.uby.dev](https://r.uby.dev) project.

It brings a single runtime for providers, agents, tools, skills, MCP,
A2A (Agent2Agent), streaming, files, and persisted state to mruby in a
form that can be embedded into small standalone applications. The
project began as a fork of [llm.rb](https://github.com/llmrb/llm.rb),
and a large number of features turned out to be portable. Both projects
generally improve each other and code continues to flow both ways.

It supports OpenAI, OpenAI-compatible endpoints, Anthropic, Google
Gemini, DeepSeek, xAI, Z.ai, Ollama, and llama.cpp. The mruby port
keeps the same overall execution model as llm.rb, but adapts it to
mruby constraints.

## Quick start

#### LLM::Context

The
[LLM::Context](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Context.html)
object is at the heart of the runtime. Almost all other features build
on top of it. It is a low-level interface to a model, and requires tool
execution to be managed manually. The
[LLM::Agent](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Agent.html)
class is almost the same as
[LLM::Context](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Context.html),
but it manages tool execution for you:

```ruby
llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["OPENAI_SECRET"])
ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm, stream: $stdout)
ctx.talk("Hello world")
```

#### LLM::Agent

The
[LLM::Agent](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Agent.html)
object is implemented on top of
[LLM::Context](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Context.html).
It provides the same interface, but manages tool execution for you. It
also includes loop guards that detect repeated tool-call patterns and
advise the model to change course rather than raise an error:

```ruby
llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["OPENAI_SECRET"])
agent = LLM::Agent.new(llm, stream: $stdout)
agent.talk("Hello world")
```

#### Agents (Advanced)

An agent can be configured to require confirmation before a tool is
executed. When a matching tool is called, mruby-llm runs
`on_tool_confirmation`. That callback must decide whether to cancel the
tool call or approve it and execute it by calling
`fn.spawn(strategy).wait`, and it must always return an instance of
[`LLM::Function::Return`](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Function/Return.html):

```ruby
require "llm"

class Agent < LLM::Agent
  tools DeleteFile
  confirm "delete-file"

  def on_tool_confirmation(fn, strategy)
    path = fn.arguments.path
    if path.start_with?("/tmp/")
      fn.spawn(strategy).wait
    else
      fn.cancel(reason: "Deletion requires approval")
    end
  end
end

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
Agent.new(llm, stream: $stdout).talk("Delete /tmp/example.txt.")
```

#### Tools

The
[LLM::Tool](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Tool.html)
class can be subclassed to implement your own tools that extend the
abilities of a model:

```ruby
class ReadFile < LLM::Tool
  name "read-file"
  description "Read a file"
  parameter :path, String, "The filename or path"
  required %i[path]

  def call(path:)
    {contents: File.read(path)}
  end
end
```

#### MCP

The
[LLM::MCP](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/MCP.html)
object lets mruby-llm use tools provided by an MCP server. Those tools
are exposed through the same runtime as local tools, so you can pass
them to either
[LLM::Context](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Context.html)
or
[LLM::Agent](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Agent.html).

Use the stdio transport to run a local MCP server:

```ruby
llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["OPENAI_SECRET"])
mcp = LLM::MCP.stdio(argv: ["ruby", "server.rb"])

mcp.run do
  ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm, stream: $stdout, tools: mcp.tools)
  ctx.talk("Use the available tools to inspect the environment.")
  ctx.talk(ctx.wait(:call)) while ctx.functions?
end
```

Use the HTTP transport with remote MCP servers:

```ruby
llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["OPENAI_SECRET"])
mcp = LLM::MCP.http(
  url: "https://remote-mcp.example.com"
)

mcp.run do
  ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm, stream: $stdout, tools: mcp.tools)
  ctx.talk("Use the available tools.")
  ctx.talk(ctx.wait(:call)) while ctx.functions?
end
```

#### A2A (Agent 2 Agent)

The
[LLM::A2A](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/A2A.html)
object lets mruby-llm use skills provided by a remote A2A agent. Those
skills are exposed through the same runtime as local tools, so you can
pass them to either
[LLM::Context](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Context.html)
or
[LLM::Agent](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Agent.html).

Use remote skills as local tools:

```ruby
a2a = LLM::A2A.rest(
  url: "https://remote-agent.example.com",
  headers: {"Authorization" => "Bearer token"}
)
llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["OPENAI_SECRET"])
ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm, tools: a2a.skills)
ctx.talk "Analyze this CSV and summarize the trends."
ctx.talk(ctx.wait(:call)) while ctx.functions?
```

For more on direct messaging, task operations, push notification
configs, and JSON-RPC, see the
[LLM::A2A API docs](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/A2A.html).

#### Skills

Skills are reusable instructions loaded from a `SKILL.md` directory.
They let you package behavior and tool access together, and they plug
into the same runtime as tools, agents, and MCP:

```yaml
---
name: release
description: Prepare a release
tools: ["read-file"]
---

## Task

Review the release state and summarize what changed.
```

```ruby
class ReleaseAgent < LLM::Agent
  model "gpt-4.1-mini"
  skills "./skills/release"
end
```

#### LLM::Stream

The
[LLM::Stream](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Stream.html)
object lets you observe output and runtime events as they happen. You
can subclass it to handle streamed content in your own application:

```ruby
require "llm"

class Stream < LLM::Stream
  def on_content(content)
    $stdout << content
  end
end

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm, stream: Stream.new)
ctx.talk "Write a haiku about Ruby."
```

#### LLM::Stream (advanced)

The
[LLM::Stream](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Stream.html)
object can also resolve tool calls while output is still streaming. In
`on_tool_call`, you can spawn the tool, push the work onto the stream
queue, and later drain it with `wait`:

```ruby
require "llm"

class Stream < LLM::Stream
  def on_content(content)
    $stdout << content
  end

  def on_tool_call(tool, error)
    return queue << error if error
    queue << ctx.spawn(tool, :call)
  end
end

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm, stream: Stream.new, tools: [ReadFile])
ctx.talk "Read README.md and summarize the quick start."
ctx.talk(ctx.wait) while ctx.functions?
```

#### Concurrency

llm.rb can run tool work concurrently. In mruby-llm, the available
strategy is `:call` for sequential execution. On
[LLM::Agent](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Agent.html),
you can set this with `concurrency`:

```ruby
class Agent < LLM::Agent
  model "gpt-4.1-mini"
  tools ReadFile
  concurrency :call
end

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["OPENAI_SECRET"])
agent = Agent.new(llm, stream: $stdout)
agent.talk "Read README.md and CHANGELOG.md and compare them."
```

#### Context Compaction

Long-lived conversations can be compacted automatically. The
[LLM::Compactor](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Compactor.html)
summarizes older history and replaces it with a compact summary. Set
`token_threshold:` as a percentage of the model's context window:

```ruby
require "llm"

class Stream < LLM::Stream
  def on_compaction(ctx, compactor)
    puts "Compacting #{ctx.messages.size} messages..."
  end

  def on_compaction_finish(ctx, compactor)
    puts "Compacted to #{ctx.messages.size} messages."
  end
end

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["OPENAI_SECRET"])
ctx = LLM::Context.new(
  llm,
  stream: Stream.new,
  compactor: {
    token_threshold: "90%",
    retention_window: 8
  }
)
```

#### Serialization

The [`LLM::Context`](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Context.html)
object can be serialized to JSON, which makes it suitable for storing
in a file, a database column, or a Redis queue:

```ruby
require "llm"

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["OPENAI_SECRET"])

# Serialize a context
ctx1 = LLM::Context.new(llm)
ctx1.talk "Remember that my favorite language is Ruby"
string = ctx1.to_json

# Restore a context (from JSON)
ctx2 = LLM::Context.new(llm, stream: $stdout)
ctx2.restore(string:)
ctx2.talk "What is my favorite language?"
```

## Integration

Add to your mruby build config:

```ruby
MRuby::Build.new("app") do |conf|
  curldir = File.expand_path(ENV["CURLDIR"] || "/usr/local")
  conf.toolchain

  conf.cc.include_paths << File.join(curldir, "include")
  conf.linker.library_paths << File.join(curldir, "lib")

  conf.gembox "default"
  conf.gem github: "llmrb/mruby-llm", branch: "main"
  conf.enable_debug
end
```

For local development in this repository, use the bundled Makefile:

```sh
make
make test
```

The Makefile expects an mruby checkout at `../mruby`. Override that with
`MRUBY_DIR=/absolute/path/to/mruby` if needed.

For direct integration into another mruby build, build through your mruby
checkout:

```sh
ruby minirake MRUBY_CONFIG=/absolute/path/to/build_config.rb
```

Dependencies are declared in [mrbgem.rake](mrbgem.rake). In practice the
main external build requirement is `libcurl`, because the runtime depends on
`mruby-curl` and `mruby-http`. The local build also expects curl headers and
libraries under `/usr/local` by default; override with
`CURLDIR=/absolute/path`.

## Dependencies

Declared mrbgem dependencies include:

- `mruby-http`
- `mruby-curl`
- `mruby-json`
- `mruby-stringio`
- `mruby-process`
- `mruby-io`
- `mruby-time`
- `mruby-env`
- `mruby-struct`
- `mruby-regexp`

See [mrbgem.rake](mrbgem.rake).
